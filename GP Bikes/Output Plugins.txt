It is possible to write a DLL that receives data from the simulated bike in realtime.

Example source code can be downloaded at http://www.gp-bikes.com/?page=downloads

Please note that all function calls are blocking, so control should be returned to simulation as soon as possible to avoid framerate issues.

The plugin must have the file extension renamed to DLO and it must be copied to the "gpbikes/plugins" directory in GP Bikes installation folder.

NOTE: a license is not needed to add plugins.
